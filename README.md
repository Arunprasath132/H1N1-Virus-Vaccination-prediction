Models and Algorithms:
This project utilizes several machine learning algorithms to predict vaccine uptake:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Bagging Classifier
AdaBoost Classifier.
Each model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most effective approach.
